A brief recap of what you learned while building this project, including something that surprised you, something that excited you, and something that frustrated you.
I learned that making a good project required asking good questions based on having learned (at least some of) the material.
I was excited and surprised about what I was able to produce with the help of my "pair programming" partner, Co-Pilot. It's a lot less daunting than in the past.
GitHub can frustrate you, but it takes time to move beyond git add., git commit, etc.

A feature in your project that you are especially proud of:
I feel the project was consistent with my interests and values. I even use my project to get vegan recipes. Well, at least concepts for recipes.

If you will continue working on your project, what will be the next thing you want to add?  
I want to add a database to persist my data non-locally.

If you are done with this project and moving on, what are you excited to begin learning about next? 
I have a new project idea of fetching stock market data and having user-generated additions to a favorites 
list of tradeable stocks suitable for swing trading.







# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
