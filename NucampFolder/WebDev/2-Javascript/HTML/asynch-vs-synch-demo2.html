    <h1>Asynchronous vs Synchronous</h1>
    <p>In programming, asynchronous and synchronous refer to the timing of operations.</p>
    <h2>Synchronous</h2>
    <p>Synchronous operations block the execution of code until the operation is complete.</p>
    <h2>Asynchronous</h2>
    <p>Asynchronous operations allow code to run without waiting for the operation to complete.</p>
<script>
    // Example of synchronous and asynchronous functions
    function syncFunction() {
        console.log('This is the start of a synchronous function.');
        for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            console.log("sync",i);
        }
        console.log('This is the end of a synchronous function.');
    }
    function asyncFunction() {
        console.log('This is the start of an asynchronous function.');
        for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            setTimeout(() => console.log("async",i), 0);
        }
        console.log('This is the end of an asynchronous function.');
    }
//
    asyncFunction();
    syncFunction();
 /** 
  * Developer console output will show that the asynchronous function does not block the synchronous function
  * The synchronous function will complete before the asynchronous one starts logging
  * This demonstrates the difference in execution timing
  * To see the output, open the console in your browser's developer tools
  * Note that synchronous code runs in the order it is called, while asynchronous code is queued to run 
  * later even when called first and even with a delay of zero.
  * In fact, the asynchronous function will not run until the synchronous function
  * has completed its execution.
  * This is why the synchronous function's output appears first in the console
  * The asynchronous function's callbacks are queued and executed after the synchronous code has finished
  * This is true even when the callback delay is set to zero
  * This is a fundamental concept in JavaScript and many other programming languages
  * Understanding this difference is crucial for writing efficient and responsive applications
  * The JavaScript event loop handles asynchronous operations
  * and ensures that the main thread is not blocked by long-running tasks.
  * This allows for a more fluid user experience in web applications
  * and is a key feature of modern JavaScript programming.
  * Non-blocking I/O operations are a common use case for asynchronous programming
  * and are essential for building scalable applications.
  * Asynchronous programming is widely used in web development,
  * especially for tasks like fetching data from APIs, handling user input,
  * and performing animations without freezing the user interface.
  * Understanding the event loop and how asynchronous code is executed
  * is crucial for developers working with JavaScript and other event-driven languages.
  * 
  * Understanding the differences between synchronous and asynchronous programming
  * can help developers make better decisions about how to structure their code
  * and improve the performance and responsiveness of their applications.
