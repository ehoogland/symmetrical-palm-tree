<h2>Scenario:</h2>
<p>Your local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) office wants to manage their waiting customers more efficiently. They need a system to handle a queue of customers, where they can add a customer to the queue, call the next customer to the counter, and display the list of people currently waiting in the queue.</p>

<p>An employee has dabbled in some HTML and basic programming, and created a simple UI for this new queue system, but they need your help to complete the functions and make the queue system work.</p>

<br>
<h2>Tasks:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>First, fork this pen to save your changes.</li>
	<li>Complete the <strong>addCustomer()</strong> function by using a push method to add the <strong>name</strong> variable to the <strong>dmvQueue</strong> array.</li>
	<li>Complete the <strong>callNextCustomer()</strong> function by using the shift method to remove the first person from the <strong>dmvQueue</strong> array. Assign this method to a new variable called <strong>nextCustomer</strong>.</li>
	<li>Complete the <strong>displayQueue()</strong> function by creating an alert message that uses the join method to display the list of elements in the <strong>dmvQueue</strong> array.</li>
</ol>

<br>
<h2>Check your code:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Click the "Add Customer" button a few times and enter some customer names.</li>
	<li>Click the "Call Next Customer" button to remove a customer from the front of the queue.</li>
	<li>Click the "Display Queue" button to see the current queue.</li>
</ol>
    <script>
        //complete the functions below to make this system operational.

let dmvQueue = [];

function addCustomer() {
	let name = prompt("Welcome to the DMV! What is your name?");
	// use a push method to add the name to the dmvQueue array.
	//dmvQueue.push(name);
	dmvQueue.push(name);

	alert("Customer " + name + " has been added to the queue.");
}

function callNextCustomer() {
	if (dmvQueue.length > 0) {
		// use the shift method to remove the first person in the array, and assign this method to a variable called "nextCustomer".
		let nextCustomer = dmvQueue.shift();
		alert("Now serving customer: " + nextCustomer);
	} else {
		alert("The queue is currently empty.");
	}
}

function displayQueue() {
	if (dmvQueue.length > 0) {
		// create an alert message that uses the join method to display the list of people currently waiting in the queue.
		alert("In queue: " + dmvQueue.join(", "));
	} else {
		alert("The queue is currently empty.");
	}
}
