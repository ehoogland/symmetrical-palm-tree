        /* 
        Function Hoisting
        Function declarations are hoisted.
        This means that before any JavaScript is executed, the code is first scanned for function declarations and any that are found are "hoisted" to the top of their scope. 
        Practically speaking, that means you can use functions that were created with function declarations before you get to them in the code. 
        For an example of this, take the last function call you wrote and place it above the function declaration and run the code. It should run the same. 
        This is not always necessarily a good thing, but you should be aware of this behavior.
