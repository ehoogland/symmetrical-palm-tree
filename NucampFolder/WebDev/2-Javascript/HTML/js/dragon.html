*/If you were to just type in the property name without the object name,
 it would not work. Try it:

maxHP

This shows you that the property is attached to the object, 
unlike a variable, which you can access without giving an object name first.

/*
Arrays are a special type of object, but less flexible 
Arrays have items, as objects have properties, but array items are always accessed by a numeric index whereas objects are accessed by property names that are set by the programmer.
You can also add custom methods to objects, whereas you cannot create custom methods for arrays.

When declaring an object, you can add a method. Type the below into your console
