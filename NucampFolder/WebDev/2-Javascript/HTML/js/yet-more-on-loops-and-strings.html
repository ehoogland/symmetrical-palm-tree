        // More on Loops and Strings

        // This script demonstrates how to use loops to manipulate strings in JavaScript.
const pets = ['dog', 'cat', 'fish'];
for (let i = 0; i < pets.length; i++) {
   console.log('I have a', pets[i]);
}
// JavaScript gives us an easier way to iterate over an array with a for loop, called a for ... of loop.
// Because we don't intend to change the value of pet inside the for loop, it is appropriate to use the const variable declaration keyword:
// We can replicate the results from the above example like this:

for (const pet of pets) {
   console.log('I have a', pet);
}
console.log(pets) // This will print the entire array of pets to the console. 

// bracket notation is used to access the elements of an array.
for (let i = 0; i < pets.length; i++) {
   pets[i] = pets[i].toUpperCase();
}
console.log(pets)
/*
Iterating through arrays of data is a very common need in programming.
Thus, there are even more ways to iterate over arrays, including the 
array methods called array.map(), array.filter(), array.find(), array.forEach().

We will not learn about these for now because they involve using a type of function 
called a callback function, which are functions that are passed as arguments 
into other functions. 

You will learn about callback functions in Week 1 of the React course.

// The for ... of loop is a great way to iterate over arrays, 
// but it can also be used with strings.
