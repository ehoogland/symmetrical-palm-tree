    <h1>Asynchronous vs Synchronous</h1>
    <p>In programming, asynchronous and synchronous refer to the timing of operations.</p>
    <h2>Synchronous</h2>
    <p>Synchronous operations block the execution of code until the operation is complete.</p>
    <h2>Asynchronous</h2>
    <p>Asynchronous operations allow code to run without waiting for the operation to complete.</p>

        function firstFunction() {
            setTimeout(() => {
                console.log(1);
            }, 100);// This will log 1 after 100 milliseconds
        };
        /**
         * This function is called immediately after firstFunction.
         * It will log 2 to the console.
