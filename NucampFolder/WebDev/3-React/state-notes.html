        <code><pre>
A stateful variable is a variable whose value changes over time to reflect 
changes in your app. 

State is the status of any stateful variables at any given point in time.
For example, a button that tracks whether it has been clicked or not is a stateful variable.
When the button is clicked, the state of that variable changes from false to true.
This is a stateful variable since it keeps track of changing state.

<p>Global or application state is used to contain data that is shared between different parts 
of your application, or obtained from outside of the application, such as from a server or user input.
</p>
<p>
In React, state is always stored in the form of a JavaScript object. This can be either a local 
state object which is maintained in the local scope of a specific component, or it can be a 
global state object.</p>

<p>Global state in React is usually handled by a state library such as Redux.</p>

<p>In React, state is always immutable, meaning that it cannot be mutated (changed). 
If we want to mutate the state, we must create an entirely new state object using specific 
functions provided by React, e.g. the useState() hook. </p>
<p>
When using Redux, state is also immutable, and we use specific functions to create a new state object 
when we want to change the state.
When using Redux, global application state is maintained in a store object, 
which contains the state of the entire application. 
Since we used the redux template when scaffolding out our nucampsite project using create-react-app, 
there is already a file named store.js in the nucampsite/src/app/ folder, which we will be using later.
Also with Redux, reducer functions are used to update the global state. 

We will learn more about, and implement, reducer functions later when we implement Redux in our app.

Finally, the logic pertaining to the global data for each feature of our app will be accounted for 
with a portion of our global state called a slice. This allows us to organize the global state into 
more manageable chunks. We will implement our first slice in the following exercise
when we implement the campsites feature in our app.
